# RAGmap üó∫Ô∏èüîç

## Overview

A simple Streamlit application powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) that helps visualize document chunks and queries in embedding space.

> Inspired by DeepLearning.ai's short course on [Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/advanced-retrieval-for-ai/) and Gabriel Chua's award-winning [RAGxplorer](https://github.com/gabrielchua/RAGxplorer).

‚òùÔ∏è **Important notice:** As of January 2024, chromadb's `AmazonBedrockEmbeddingFunction` only works with Titan models. Feel free to upvote this [PR](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/pull/1675) to add support for [Cohere Embed models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-embed.html).
